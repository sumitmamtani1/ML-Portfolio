This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) projects undertaken as part of my coursework and personal interests.

# Projects Included

+ RAG-Insurance-ChatBot - This project is an AI-powered chatbot for InsureLLM, built with LangChain, Chroma, OpenAI, and Gradio. Using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, it provides instant, accurate responses to insurance-related queries by pulling information from a vector store.(Knowledge Base for this is available as well)
+  Loan Repayment Classifier - A Keras-based neural network using Dense layers and Sequential API to classify whether a loan will be repaid or not.
+ Customer-Churn-Prediction - Predicted likelihood of Customer Churn/Retention using Random Forest Classifier.
+ House-Price-Prediction - This project analyzes King County housing data to build a neural network model using Keras' Sequential API with Dense layers to predict house prices based on various features.
+ Brain-Tumor-Classification - This project classifies MRI brain images to detect the presence of a tumor using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Sequential and Transfer Learning models, achieving 98% accuracy. It leverages deep learning to assist in early and accurate brain tumor diagnosis.
+ Gender And Age Prediction -  Keras implementation of a CNN for estimating age and gender from a face image.
+ Customer-Segmentation-using-Machine-Learning - Used K-Means Clustering to classify customers into different groups.
+ Cancer-Classification - Using Keras deep learning to predict whether a patientâ€™s tumor is benign or malignant through binary classification.
+ Predict Rating based on Review(text) - Used NLP to Predict business rating based on user review.
+ Advanced Recommender System - Model based CF and Memory based CF using svds implementation for recommending movies.
+ Spam Message Detection - Detecting spam messages using Natural Processing ToolKit(NLTK).
+ Taxi Tip Prediction - Predicting Tip Amount in New York using Keras.
